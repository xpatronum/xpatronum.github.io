**In November, flux-1.1 pro \| ultra was released** ([link](https://blackforestlabs.ai/flux-1-1-ultra/)) — it’s like MidJourney, but in real-time and much faster. According to the statements:

> *support 4x higher image resolutions (up to 4MP) while maintaining an impressive generation time of only 10 seconds per sample.*

From personal experience, it indeed seems to work as described. A wrapper for interaction and a Jupyter notebook have been published here: [note-flux.ipynb](https://github.com/atomicai/justatom/blob/master/notebook/note-flux.ipynb).
